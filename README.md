Hi, I’m Adrian Cintras.
I’m currently working on my Bachelor of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence at Miami Dade College.

I’m passionate about building cool, forward-thinking tech—projects that’ll actually shape how people live and interact with the world in the near future. I like working on projects that blend creativity and smart systems, and I’m always learning something new along the way.

This repo is where I’ll be dropping my AI projects, experiments, and anything else I think is worth sharing. Stick around.
